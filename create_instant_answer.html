<p>We recommend that your first live contribution to Instant Answers is to
improve one that&#39;s already live. Many contributors report completing their
first fix within two hours of forking the repository.</p>

<p>The best place to get started is by looking at &quot;low-hanging fruit&quot;
fixes, which we&#39;ve made sure to identify throughout our repositories for
new contributors.</p>

<p>Fixing a small bug is a great hands-on way to learn how each Instant Answer
functions. Feel free to <a href="mailto:open@duckduckgo.com">ask us
anything</a>, and don&#39;t forget to check out the <a href=

<p>By this point, you&#39;re more comfortable with contributing, and have a
better idea of the Instant Answer framework. Now it&#39;s time to think about
creating an Instant Answer of your own!</p>

<p>Bring your own idea, or check out the ideas forum - especially <a href=
"https://duck.co/ideas/status/3?table_lnKRpLENwO2NUmZUyukQpw_sort=votes">top
voted answer ideas</a>.</p>

<p>The first step is to research and plan your Instant Answer. Consider
<a href="https://duck.co/duckduckhack/determine_your_instant_answer_type">the
best way to implement</a> your idea, and <a href=
"mailto:open@duckduckgo.com">involve us in your thinking</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The first step to implementing an Instant Answer is to let us know
you&#39;re working on one:</strong> Email us at <a href=
"mailto:open@duckduckgo.com">open@duckduckgo.com</a> and let us know what idea
you&#39;re working on, as well as your initial thoughts on implementation.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll help you plan, using our experience from current Instant Answers.
We&#39;ll also be ready to answer your questions along the way. We&#39;ll
create a <a href="http://www.duck.co/ia">central Instant Answer page</a> on the
community platform so others can know you&#39;re working on it and how they can
help you.</p>
