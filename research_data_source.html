<h1>Research a Data Source</h1>

<p>Instant Answers are only as valuable as the results they provide. <a href=
"https://duck.co/duckduckhack/spice_overview">Spice Instant Answers</a> results
come from carefully chosen external data sources. For example, the <a href=
"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters&amp;ia=movies">In Theaters</a>
Instant Answer pulls its data from the <a href=
"http://www.rottentomatoes.com/">Rotten Tomatoes</a> API, while the <a href=
"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AA%20102&amp;ia=flights">Airlines</a> Instant Answer
reflects data from <a href="http://www.flightstats.com/">FlightStats</a>.</p>

<p>Finding quality data helps the community in a very big way. There are many
amazing ideas for Instant Answers that are waiting for a great data source, and
the community could use your help.</p>
