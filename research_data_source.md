# Research a Data Source

Instant Answers are only as useful as their results. [*Spice* Instant Answers](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/spice_overview) results come from external data sources. For example, the [In Theaters](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=currently+in+theaters&ia=movies) Instant Answer pulls its data from the [Rotten Tomatoes](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/) API, while the [Airlines](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=AA%20102&ia=flights) Instant Answer reflects data from [FlightStats](http://www.flightstats.com/).

Finding quality data helps the community in a very big way. There are many amazing ideas for Instant Answers that are waiting for a great data source, and the community could use your help.

## Learn What Makes a Good Data Source

The first step is to learn what qualifies a data source as appropriate for use in an Instant Answer. It's no secret that while the web has no shortage of available data, high-quality sources are harder to come by.

Start by reviewing the [criteria for Spice data sources](https://duck.co/duckduckhack/spice_overview#important-spice-criteria). If you'd like clarification, or need help understanding some of the terms, feel free to email us at [open@duckduckgo.com](open@duckduckgo.com)
