<h1>Lead a Co-Hacking Meetup Group</h1>

<p>Passionate about DuckDuckGo? Love hacking with other people? Care about a particular field - and feel it could use better Instant Answer coverage?</p>

<p>Organizing DuckDuckGo Co-Hacking Meetups (Quack &amp; Hacks!) is a really fun way to bring people together to build live, open-source Instant Answers together. </p>

<p>See our current worldwide meetups: <a href="http://duckduckgo.meetup.com/">http://duckduckgo.meetup.com/</a></p>

<h2>Becoming a Host</h2>

<p>Organizing a meetup group is a fun, rewarding experience and you don't need to be a DuckDuckHack expert or veteran developer to lead your own! (In fact, it&#39;s a great way to organize your first tech event, since you&#39;ll have our support and experience behind you.)</p>

<p>Shoot us an email with short answers to the following questions (so we know how to best help):</p>

<ul>
	<li>Where are you located? When are you thinking about hosting the event?</li>
	<li>Experience (if any) personally creating or improving DuckDuckGo Instant Answers? Send us a link!</li>
	<li>Experience (if any) hosting tech meetups</li>
</ul>

<p>These questions will let us know how to support you as a meetup host. </p>

<p>Email them to <a href="mailto:meetup@duckduckgo.com">meetup@duckduckgo.com</a> - we should get back to you the same day. </p>

<h2>Pick a Venue (and Your Favorite Pizza)</h2>

<p>Great venues include: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Co-working spaces (they often love hosting open-source meetups).</li>
	<li>Spacious tech offices (startups tend to jump at the chance to host).</li>
	<li>Community locations: universities, maker spaces, and so on!</li>
</ul>

<p>Food makes people happy, bond, and stay longer. Pizza is usually easiest and most agreeable option - we&#39;ve got tons of tips we&#39;ll share on how to do this (including getting it sponsored).</p>

<h2>Create an Event and Spread the Word</h2>

<p>We&#39;ll help you think through:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Promoting your group and event.</li>
	<li>Working with new members.</li>
	<li>Communicating the group event timeline.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our staff and <a href="https://duck.co/help/community/community-leaders">Community Leaders</a> have a ton of great advice to share from our experience - from how to increase attendance, to the best event tools, to free Uber vouchers.</p>

<h2>We&#39;ll Totally Be There</h2>

<p>Well, maybe not physically - but in every other way! We&#39;ll guide you at every step of creating your event, from planning the details, to promotion, to even having DuckDuckHack staff or community leader on live help standby during the event.</p>

<h2>Grow</h2>

<p>Our aim is for every group to meet at least once per month. We'll help you grow your group into a real force to be reckoned with in the open source community!</p>

<h2>Get Started</h2>
