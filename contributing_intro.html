<h2>Contributing Matters</h2>

<p>We know that Wikipedia would always beat out Encarta. We believe that DuckDuckGo is an incredible distribution platform for an open-source community to change how the web works. We&#39;re up against multi-billion-dollar giants - and the only way to avoid becoming them is to be inseparable from the community.</p>

<p>Our first goal is to have <strong>85% of queries covered by Instant Answers</strong> (currently this is at 19%).</p>

<p>Our second goal is to have our <strong>top 30 languages 100% translated</strong> (right now DDG is fully translated in 18 languages).</p>
