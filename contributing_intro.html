<h2>Contributing Matters</h2>

<p>We know that Wikipedia would always beat out Encarta. We believe that DuckDuckGo is an incredible distribution platform for an open-source community to change how the web works. We&#39;re up against multi-billion-dollar giants - and the only way to avoid becoming them is to be inseparable from the community.</p>

<p>Our goal is to have <strong>85% of queries covered by Instant Answers</strong> (currently this is at 19%).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had my first ever pull request merged by @duckduckhack. Yay! I helped make the internet a better place! @duckduckgo @duckco </p>
